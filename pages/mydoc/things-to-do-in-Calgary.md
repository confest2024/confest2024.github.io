Calgary is situated on an ancient and storied land that is steeped in ceremony and history that, until recently, was occupied exclusively by people indigenous to this place including the Siksika Nation, the Piikani Nation, the Kainai Nation, the Îethka Stoney Nakoda Nation (consisting of the Chiniki, Bearspaw and Goodstoney Nations), the people of the Tsuut’ina Nation, and the Métis. Indigenous Tourism Alberta, [https://indigenoustourismalberta.ca/](https://indigenoustourismalberta.ca/) has some fantastic opportunities to explore the rich cultural heritage of this place.</p>
