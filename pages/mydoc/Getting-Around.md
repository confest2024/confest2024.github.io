### Getting to Conference Hotels from Calgary International Airport

- <div style="text-align: justify;">Taxis and rideshare services (Uber) are the best way to get to the conference hotels from the airport. Depending on the time, an Uber ride will cost from $20 CAD to $30 CAD. The ride will take about 25 minutes during off-peak hours.</div>
- <div style="text-align: justify;">Public transit is available but will take considerably longer and involves a transfer from bus to train. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mr3jvxek" target="_blank">More info here</a>.</div>

### Getting to Downtown, Dining, and Tourist Attractions

- <div style="text-align: justify;">The conference hotels are right next to the “Banff Trail” Light Rail Station. Take the train going towards “City Centre”. You can find varied dining options near the “Sunnyside” station (10 minutes) and stations near the downtown core (e.g., “Centre Street” station) (15 minutes).</div>
- <div style="text-align: justify;">There are many dining options within walking distance from the hotel. A few can be found in <a href="https://tinyurl.com/3h7khhpj" target="_blank">this link</a>.</div>
