Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for **ONE DAY/TWO** DAYS workshops on topics related to theory, formal modeling, verification, performance evaluation and engineering of concurrent, timed, industrial, and other systems. Typically, CONFEST workshops feature a number of invited speakers and a number of contributed presentations. The workshops will run concurrently with the main conferences between September 09 to September 13, 2024.

### Topics
The purpose of the workshops is to provide participants with a friendly, stimulating, and interactive atmosphere for:
* presenting novel ideas,
* discussing new ideas on emerging research areas, challenging problems, and industrial applications,
* encouraging inter-disciplinary research between industry and academia, and fostering opportunities for young and prospective researchers.

### Organization
CONFEST’24 is planned as a physical, in-person event, with some support for remote participation. In a limited number of cases, there will be remote-participation support for speakers and for other participants who are unable to come. Please take this into account when preparing a workshop proposal and communicate to participants requiring such support that they should contact the organizers of CONFEST’24 explaining their case.

We will provide the following to workshop organizers:
* Meeting rooms on demand.
* Coffee breaks and catering for lunch, both are included.
* The CONFEST'24 website cannot be made accessible for edits by third parties but workshop organizers can either host their own website and provide a link to it that we put on CONFEST website, or they can send us their content and we will put it on the website.
* Registration will be centralized by CONFEST. 
* Special rates for hotels, as well as local information, can be found on the <a href="https://confest2024.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">website</a>

### Instructions for proposal submission
Workshop proposals should include:

* The name and the preferred date of the proposed workshop.
